- similar to proteins to proteins
- use ACTG instead of 20 amino acids
- can be _very_ long
	- proteins $5000$ vs DNA $100,000,000$s 
- can easily replicate
- DNA can do approx. string matching
	- approx because if most are matching then they can still connect
## RNA
- less stable than DNA (no double helix structure)
	- breaks down eventually, into reusable parts
- mRNA has a bunch of $A$s 
## Central Dogma
- stores & replicates data
- mRNA from DNA, then protein from mRNA
- transcription: copy, same alphabet
- translation: uses different languages (ACTG to amino acids)

## Copying
- _UTR_ - untranslated region
	- $5'$ side is leader 
	- $3'$ side is trailer
- everything is copied, including UTR
- introns removed, exons remain
- have special signals at the beginning of exons
- GT's and AG's(?)
### Alternative Splicing
- can splice exons in multiple ways
- cell decides to take or not take an exon
- order has to stay the same
- one of the main mechanisms that allows for cell differentiation
- _isoform/alternative transcripts_ - same gene, different splicing
	- can choose alternative $3'$ and $5'$ UTRs too
- Get human genome: we get all the exons but don't necessarily know which ones for which cell type
- __computational question__: How to reconstruct the exons?
	- how many isoforms there are, how to connect them together
#### Muscular Dystrophy
- all caused by alternative splicing
- mild: skip many
- severe: only skipping 1, but stop codon is different place than it should be
## Transcription Control
- how does the cell decide when to express (make a copy of into RNA) a gene?
- genes have to have certain combination of binding sites w/ signal
	- _promoter_
- enhancers have binding sites for proteins
	- dist btwn is really big from gene, but can often be actually close b/c of folding
- enhancer & promoter work together
	- both "upstream" from gene
	- "flow" is from $5'$ to $3'$
- __computational question__: How to find binding sites?
## Genomes
- histones neutralize charge of DNA so you can squish it closer together
	- DNA negatively charged, would want to be straight
- _single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)_ - what makes humans unique between each other
## Epigenomes
- cytosine with methylation more likely to be suppressed than one without a lot of methylation
	- can't just use ATCG, have to know which C's are methylated too
- epigenome is changed based off lifestyle
	- genome don't change, but epigenome will
- epigenome observed to be similar in offspring
