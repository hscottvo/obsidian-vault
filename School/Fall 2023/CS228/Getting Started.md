#intro 
# What is Deep Learning?
- main difference from ML: learn from #neuralnetwork 
- different layers of neural nets can do low- or high-level features
	- edges vs facial features vs full faces
## Representation
- #representation
	- sometimes need to use specific classifiers to deal with certain data
	- example 1.1 from slides: can use polar coordinates vs cartesian coordinates
		- can just use linear classifier here
	- this is a simple example, can code transformations by hand
### Representation Learning
- example: cats & dogs
- images very hard (impossible) to transform data to use a simple classifier
# Why Deep Learning?
- amount of global data growing exponentially
	- more data to learn from
	- 15 million data points in ImageNet from 2009
		- can't learn with simple linear classifier
		- lots more categories as well
