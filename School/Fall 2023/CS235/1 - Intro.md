`4 V's of data`
1. volume: amount of data
	- 
2. velocity: how fast to process the data
	- want to do analysis on real time data? Have to have good velocity
3.  variety: different data sources & types
	- different representations of data
	- can come in different forms/varieties
4.  veracity: dealing with incorrect data
	- mismatch
	- missing
## What is Data Mining?
`knowledge discovery from data`: #KDD
- finding patterns in data and utilizing them to your advantage
- not data mining: query data
	- called `data management`
# Data Mining Pipeline
- preprocessing
	1. take raw data
	2. clean data
		- handle missing data, outliers
	3. extract features
	4. dimensinoality reduction
- analysis
- post-processing
# Supervised vs Unsupervised
- Supervised 
	- classification, regression
- unsupervised
	- clustering
# Bias
- unrepresentative data
- unbalanced data
- bias in labelling (human bias in giving out loans)
