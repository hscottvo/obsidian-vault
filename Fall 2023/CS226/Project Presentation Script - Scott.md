The Yelp Open Dataset comes from their Dataset Challenges. It consists of a subset of their internal data, describing 10 metropolitan areas around the United States. Some examples of relevant attributes include a business's location in latitude and longitude, their rating on a 1-to-5 scale as well as associated keywords. 

Our secondary dataset is pulled from the US Census. We will be pulling race and age data for counties across the United States, and exploring the relationship between cultures and which restaurants are popular. We can also look at the distribution of age groups, so we can see how different age distributions can be correlated with how restaurants are rated. We will be selecting counties that are within the metropolitan areas included in the Yelp dataset.
