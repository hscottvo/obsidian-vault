## Heuristic
- G-cost is basically justh ow much it cost to get to that point so far
	- $G(n)$
	- miles, operators, etc
- UCS is a specific version of BFS
- Bi-directional search very little overhead in checking if the 2 trees have met
	- hashing/bloom filter
- _diameter_ - worst possible depth of a search problem
