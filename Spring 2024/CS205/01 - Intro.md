## Where Are We in AI?
- performance metric: between sub-human and optimal
### Optimal
- algorithms solve optimally, can't do any better
- arithmetic, checkers
	- algorithms that can play certain games perfectly
- rubik's cube
### Super-Human
- not necessarily optimal but better than humans
- self-driving (with qualifications)
	- fewer accidents per mile
	- mostly drive in california/arizona
		- very clear traffic rules, nice pavement, very good lighting
### Par-Human
- some of these may not be in the category anymore
- image class especially getting closer to super-human
### Sub-Human
- many things out of date due to chatgpt etc
- usually have issues with _common sense_
## Water Jug Problem
- end goal could be (2, n) _or_ (n, 2)

## Search Tree
- $b$ can be the average of branching factors $b$ if there exists different branching factors
- small branching factors are better for us
- space complexity can end up being a tighter constraint than time complexity
