## Restriction Genomes
- look for specific string in genome, then cut certain spot there
- EcoR1 cuts GAATTC into G + AATTC on 1 strand and CTTAA + G on the other strand
- most if not all restriction genomes are palindromes
- cutting process called digestion
- the G on one strand and the CTTAA will still be connected to each other, TTAA is called "sticky strand"
## Gel Electrophoresis
- put DNA in "lanes" in a swimming pool
- electrical charge makes DNA go from one side to another
- smaller DNA go further because less friction
	- stops when equilibrium between friction & charge
## DNA Fingerprinting
- use restriction enzymes on different DNA's
	- similar cuts mean similar DNA

## Cloning
- how to make bacteria clone? Just feed them and they will duplicate
- add EcoR1 to bacteria genome to open the circle
- cut our target DNA with EcoR1
	- both our target DNA and bacteria DNA will have sticky ends
	- use DNA Ligase to connect sticky ends btwn bacteria and our target DNA
- Downside: don't know which piece gets cloned in which bacteria
- have to know the bacteria genome
	- if know restriction areas in the bacteria, can know where the clone starts and ends
## Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
- only amplify on certain DNA's
- denature to single strand, then clone
	- keep on cloning, if the DNA matches, then will exponentially expand until you can actually see it
